# Supercapacitor-Charger
This project is about making use of supercapacitors in similar ways to that of batteries.
I am also interested in carbon free energy and human powered projects, hence the source of charging the capacitors is by a bike generator or solar panels.
The design charges a series set of 6 500F supercapacitors that feed the power to 5V usb.
Since supercapacitors can be charged at much higher currents than chemical batteries, they have capured my attention.
